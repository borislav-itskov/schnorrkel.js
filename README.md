# Schnorr Signatures
A javaScript library for signing and verifying Schnorr Signatures.  
It can be used for single and multi signatures.  
Blockchain validation via ecrecover is also supported.  

# Typescript support
Since version 2.0.0, we're moving entirely to Typescript.

## Version 2.0 Breaking changes
* `sign()` and `multiSigSign()` return an instance of `SignatureOutput`. Each element in it has a buffer property
  * instead of `e` we return `challenge` for the Schnorr Challenge. To accces its value, use `challenge.buffer`
  * instead of `s` we return `signature` for the Schnorr Signature. To accces its value, use `signature.buffer`
  * instead of `R` we return `publicNonce` for the nonce. To accces its value, use `publicNonce.buffer`
* `getCombinedPublicKey()` returns a `Key` class. To get the actual key, use `key.buffer`
* a lot of method become static as they don't keep any state:
  * `verify`
  * `sign`
  * `sumSigs`
  * `getCombinedPublicKey`
  * `getCombinedAddress`

## Version 3.0 Breaking changes
* `finalPublicNonce`, `FinalPublicNonce` is replaced everywhere with `publicNonce`, `PublicNonce`. The old name just didn't make sense.
* `sign()` is the former `signHash()`. A sign function that accepts a plain-text message as an argument no longer exists.
* `multiSigSign()` is the former `multiSigSignHash()`. A sign function that accepts a plain-text message as an argument no longer exists.
* `verify()` is the former `verifyHash()`. A verification function that accepts a plain-text message as an argument no longer exists.

In version 2, we had plenty of ways to sign a message. This broad a lot of confusion as to what function was the correct one to use in various situations. This lead us to believe that making things simpler and forcing a hash to be passed to the methods is the way forward.

## Requirements:

* Node: >=16.0.0, <20.0.0
* npm (Node.js package manager) v9.x.x

```

## Testing

```

## Usage

### Single Signatures
We refer to Single Signatures as ones that have a single signer.

Sign:
```js
import Schnorrkel from '@borislav.itskov/schnorrkel.js'

const privateKey = new Key(Buffer.from(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32)))
const msg = 'test message'
const hash = ethers.utils.hashMessage(msg)
const {signature, publicNonce, challenge} = Schnorrkel.sign(privateKey, hash)
```

Offchain verification:
We take the `signature`, `hash` and `publicNonce` from the example above and do:
```js
const publicKey = Buffer.from(secp256k1.publicKeyCreate(privateKey.buffer))
// signature and publicNonce come from Schnorrkel.sign
const result = Schnorrkel.verify(signature, hash, publicNonce, publicKey)
```

Onchain verification:

First, you will need a contract that verifies schnorr. We have it in the repository and it is called `SchnorrAccountAbstraction`.  
But all in all, you need this onchain:
```js
function verifySchnorr(bytes32 hash, bytes memory sig) internal pure returns (bool) {
    // px := public key x-coord
    // e := schnorr signature challenge
    // s := schnorr signature
    // parity := public key y-coord parity (27 or 28)
    (bytes32 px, bytes32 e, bytes32 s, uint8 parity) = abi.decode(sig, (bytes32, bytes32, bytes32, uint8));
    // ecrecover = (m, v, r, s);
    bytes32 sp = bytes32(Q - mulmod(uint256(s), uint256(px), Q));
    bytes32 ep = bytes32(Q - mulmod(uint256(e), uint256(px), Q));

    require(sp != Q);
    // the ecrecover precompile implementation checks that the `r` and `s`
    // inputs are non-zero (in this case, `px` and `ep`), thus we don't need to
    // check if they're zero.
    address R = ecrecover(sp, parity, px, ep);
    require(R != address(0), "ecrecover failed");
    return e == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(R, uint8(parity), px, hash));
}
```

We explain how ecrecover works and why it is needed later [in this document](#ecrecover).  
Let's send a request to the local hardhat node. First run in the terminal:  
npx hardhat node  
Afterwards, here is part of the code:
```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
import secp256k1 from 'secp256k1'

const privateKey = new Key(Buffer.from(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32)))
const publicKey = secp256k1.publicKeyCreate(ethers.utils.arrayify(privateKey))
const px = publicKey.slice(1, 33)
const pxGeneratedAddress = ethers.utils.hexlify(px)
const schnorrAddr = '0x' + pxGeneratedAddress.slice(pxGeneratedAddress.length - 40, pxGeneratedAddress.length)
const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(SchnorrAccountAbstraction.abi, SchnorrAccountAbstraction.bytecode, wallet)
const contract: any = await factory.deploy([schnorrAddr])

const pkBuffer = new Key(Buffer.from(ethers.utils.arrayify(privateKey)))
const msg = 'just a test message';
const msgHash = ethers.utils.hashMessage(msg)
const sig = Schnorrkel.sign(pkBuffer, msgHash)

// wrap the result
const publicKey = secp256k1.publicKeyCreate(ethers.utils.arrayify(privateKey))
const px = publicKey.slice(1, 33);
const parity = publicKey[0] - 2 + 27;
const abiCoder = new ethers.utils.AbiCoder();
const sigData = abiCoder.encode([ "bytes32", "bytes32", "bytes32", "uint8" ], [
    px,
    sig.challenge.buffer,
    sig.signature.buffer,
    parity
]);
const result = await contract.isValidSignature(msgHash, sigData);
```

You can see the full implementation in `tests/schnorrkel/onchainSingleSign.test.ts` in this repository.

### Multisig

Schnorr multisignatures work on the basis n/n - all of the signers need to sign in order for the signature to be valid.  
Below are all the steps needed to craft a successful multisig.

#### Public nonces

Public nonces need to be exchanged between signers before they sign. Normally, the Signer should implement this library as define a `getPublicNonces` method that will call the library and return the nonces. For our test example, we're going to call the schnorrkel library directly:

```js
const privateKey1: Buffer = '...'
const privateKey2: Buffer = '...'
const publicNonces1 = schnorrkel.generatePublicNonces(privateKey1);
const publicNonces2 = schnorrkel.generatePublicNonces(privateKey2);
```

Again, this isn't how the flow is supposed to work. A signer needs to implement the library and when `getPublicNonces` is called, the user should be ask whether he is okay to generate and give his public nonces.

#### sign

After we have them, here is how to sign:

```js
const publicKey1: Buffer = '...'
const publicKey2: Buffer = '...'
const publicKeys = [publicKey1, publicKey2];
const combinedPublicKey = schnorrkel.getCombinedPublicKey(publicKeys)
const {signature: sigOne, challenge: e, publicNonce} = signerOne.multiSignMessage(msg, publicKeys, publicNonces)
const {signature: sigTwo} = signerTwo.multiSignMessage(msg, publicKeys, publicNonces)
const sSummed = Schnorrkel.sumSigs([sigOne, sigTwo])
```

#### verify onchain

```js
const px = combinedPublicKey.buffer.slice(1,33);
const parity = combinedPublicKey.buffer[0] - 2 + 27;
const abiCoder = new ethers.utils.AbiCoder();
const sigData = abiCoder.encode([ "bytes32", "bytes32", "bytes32", "uint8" ], [
    px,
    challenge.buffer,
    sSummed.buffer,
    parity
]);
const msgHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['string'], [msg]);
const result = await contract.isValidSignature(msgHash, sigData);
```

#### verify offchain

```js
const result = schnorrkel.verify(sSummed, msg, publicNonce, combinedPublicKey);
```

You can find reference to this in `tests/schnorrkel/onchainMultiSign.test.ts` in this repository.

## ecrecover
For the schnorr on-chain verification, we were inspired by the work of [noot](https://github.com/noot). Without his work, it would've required a lot more time for RnD to reach this point. You can take a look at his repository [here](https://github.com/noot/schnorr-verify)

We utilize Ethereum ecrecover to verify the signature. This is how it works:  
Ethereum ecrecover returns an address (hash of public key) given an ECDSA signature.
Given message m and ECDSA signature (v, r, s) where v denotes the parity of the y-coordinate for the point where x-coordinate r

```
ecrecover(m, v, r, s):
R = point derived from r and v
a = -G*m
b = R*s
Qr = a + b
Q = Qr * (1/r)
Q = (1/r) * (R*s - G*m) //recovered pubkey
```

Ethereumâ€™s ecrecover returns the last 20 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the 64-byte public key.
Given signature (R, s), message m and public key P we can feed values into ecrecover such that the returned address can be used in a comparison to the challenge.

```
calculate e = H(address(R) || m) and P_x = x-coordinate of P
```

pass:
```
m = -s*P_x
v = parity of P
r = x-coordinate of P
s = -e*P_x
```

then:

```
ecrecover(m=-s*P_x, v=0/1, r=P_x, s=-e*P_x):
P = point derived from r and v (public key)
a = -G*(-s*P_x) = G*s*P_x
b = P*(-m*P_x) = -P*e*P_x
Q = (1/P_x) (a+b)
Q = (1/P_x)(G*s*P_x - P*e*P_x)
Q = G*s - P*e  // same as schnorr verify above
```

the returned value is address(Q).

* calculate e' = h(address(Q) || m)
* check e' == e to verify the signature.
